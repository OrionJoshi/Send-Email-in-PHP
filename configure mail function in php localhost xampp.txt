How to configure XAMPP to send mail from localhost using PHP ?


To configure XAMPP server to send mail from localhost first
we have to stop all the server(like apache,mysql) then we have
to make changes to two files sendmail.ini and php.ini. Open the
xampp folder.By the name of “sendmail.ini” is present in sendmail 
file and “php.ini” is present in php file in the xampp folder.

1:for making change in file "php.ini" which may be present in folder PHP inside XAMPP
Step1:comment SMTP=localhost by putting semicolon infront of it like-;SMTP=localhost
Step2:comment smtp_port=25 by putting semicolon infront of it like-;smtp_port=25
Step3:comment sendmail_from= by putting semicolon infront of it like-;sendmail_from=specify path of
Step4:file in sendmail_path to sendmail_path=C:\xampp\sendmail\sendmail.exe(This path is set where the sendmail.exe lies)
Step5:check if extension=php_openssl.dll is enabled or not If there is semicolon in front then
 un-comment it by removing that semicolon.


2:For making change in file "sendmail.ini" which may be present in folder sendmail inside XAMPP
Step1:change smtp_server=mail.yourdomain.com to smtp_server=smtp.gmail.com
Step2:change smtp_port to smtp_port=587
Step3:change smtp_ssl=auto to smtp_ssl=tls
Step4:uncomment ;error_logfile=error.log to error_logfile=error.log
Step5:uncomment ;debug_logfile=debug.log to debug_logfile=debug.log
Step6:write your gmail id in auth_username: auth_username=*****@gmail.com
Step7:write your gmail and password in auth_password: auth_password=*****
Step8:write your gmail id in force_sender: *****@gmail.com
Step9:change hostname to hostname=localhost

Thats the configur for mail sent from localhost using php
HERE IS THE SIMPLE PHP CODE FOR SENDING MAIL
<?php

	$to = "******10@gmail.com";(TO whom you want to send)

	$subject = "This is first email";(subject of mail)

	$message = "hello world!";(Message you want to send)

	$headers = "From: *****************@gmail.com";(from where you are sending)

	if(mail($to, $subject,$message,$headers)){

		echo "mail send successfuly";
	}else{

		echo "cannot send mail"	;

	You need to restart apache in order for php.ini to reload.
	You need to activate Google Less secure app access in https://myaccount.google.com/u/1/security
